# NOESCAPE.EXE - Interactive Prank

**NOESCAPE.EXE** is a harmless prank program designed for Windows 7 (I honestly don't knowif it works for anything else) that simulates a fake system crash and creates a spooky, game-like experience on your desktop.
---
## How to download
Extract the zip file. Run the .exe file.
---

## What It Does

- Creates a red "pixel spill" effect on your screen
- Removes your taskbar (makes it disappear)
- Changes your desktop background to solid red
- Simulates a fake reboot with a login screen
- Places a mysterious text file named `OPEN ME.txt` on your desktop
- Reacts to certain user interactions with dramatic effects
- Eventually restores your desktop back to normal after the prank ends

## How to Escape or Restore Your Desktop

If you get stuck or want to exit the prank early:

1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to open **Task Manager**.
2. Find and **end the process** named:
   - `NOESCAPE.exe`
   - or any associated script/process like `wscript.exe` or `cmd.exe`.
3. After that, go to **File > Run new task** in Task Manager.
4. Type the following and press Enter: **explorer.exe**

5. This will restart your taskbar and bring back your desktop icons.

Alternatively, you can simply restart your computer — the prank does not make permanent changes.

## Important Notes

- The prank only temporarily removes the taskbar; it does **not** permanently delete or damage any system files.
- All prank files are safe and can be examined or deleted at any time.
- No administrator rights are required to run or stop the prank.

Enjoy the prank responsibly!


## 📜 Tips

## 🧠 How to Win

(Only read this if you're truly stuck.)

1. After logging in, you'll see `OPEN ME.txt` on your desktop.
2. Scroll all the way to the bottom of that file.
3. You’ll find a hidden instruction: **press the `Escape` key 5 times**.
4. That will trigger the climax — the screen goes red, warnings appear, and all processes end.
5. Eventually the red fades, and you’ll hear the **Windows 7 startup sound**.
6. A final message appears:  
👉 “**You saved me!**”

Now you’ve completed the story. 🎉
